                  Our poster won runner's up in Paul Baran’s Young Scholar’s Celestini Prize India. Acknowledging the adverse effects of the deteriorating air quality, we proposed VisionAir: A privacy preserving android application which is used to build an air quality monitoring system that allows users to be aware and take protective measures against such toxic air. It does so by analysing the air around the user from an image of the surrounding area using a deep learning model we trained. The model was trained on a diverse dataset of High Dynamic Range images.

                  We built EazyCharge, an application for charging operators to maximize their audience without comprimising on the profits. We implemented a dynamic pricing system which took several parameters, such as the current price, the predicted audience in the near future, the number of users in near vicinity, and many others that the operator may choose for better balance between its audience and profit.
